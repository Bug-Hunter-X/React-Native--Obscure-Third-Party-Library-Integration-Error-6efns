This error occurs when using a third-party library in React Native that has not been properly integrated or is incompatible with your project setup.  It's often masked by other errors, making debugging difficult. The specific error message may vary depending on the library, but it usually points to a failure in native module linking or bridging.  For example, you might see a message that a native module is not found, or an undefined is not a function error related to the third-party library.

Example scenario:
Let's say you're using a library `react-native-maps`. You've installed it correctly, but you are getting a runtime error during app launch.  This might be because the native modules of `react-native-maps` aren't properly linked to your Android or iOS project. 

```javascript
import MapView from 'react-native-maps';

const MyMap = () => {
  return (
    <MapView style={{flex:1}} />
  );
};
```

This code seems fine, but the app crashes because the native modules for map rendering failed to link correctly.
