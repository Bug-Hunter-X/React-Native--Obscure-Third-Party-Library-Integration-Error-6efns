The solution to this kind of error depends on the specific library used. Generally, it involves ensuring the native modules are properly linked.

**Steps for troubleshooting:**

1. **Verify Library Installation:** Double-check that the third-party library is correctly installed and its dependencies are satisfied.  Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to ensure everything is up-to-date.

2. **Check Native Module Linking (Android):** If you're using Android, ensure that the native modules are correctly linked.  This often involves modifying the `android/app/build.gradle` and `android/settings.gradle` files.  You might need to add necessary dependencies or update the build configuration.  Consult the third-party library documentation for precise steps for Android linking.

3. **Check Native Module Linking (iOS):**  For iOS, the native modules should be correctly configured in your Xcode project.  Check the project's podfile (`ios/Podfile`) and ensure all necessary pods are included.  You might need to run `pod install` or `pod update` to update your pods.

4. **Clean and Rebuild:** After making changes to your native project, always clean and rebuild your React Native application.  In Android Studio, use the "Clean Project" option.  In Xcode, perform a clean build.

5. **Check Library Documentation:** Always refer to the third-party library's documentation for any specific integration instructions or known issues.  The documentation usually contains essential steps and troubleshooting tips.

6. **Debugging Native Modules (Advanced):** If the above steps don't help, you might need to dive into debugging the native modules themselves. This requires more advanced knowledge of Android (Java/Kotlin) and iOS (Objective-C/Swift) development.  The debugging process will vary depending on the specific library. 

**Example (Illustrative - Adjust for your specific library):**

Let's say the `react-native-maps` library has native modules that are not correctly linked.  The solution could involve adding additional dependencies in `android/app/build.gradle` and verifying that the appropriate pods are present and up-to-date in `ios/Podfile`.  Always consult the documentation for the specific library you are using.
