# React Native: Obscure Third-Party Library Integration Error

This repository demonstrates a common yet tricky bug in React Native: errors stemming from the integration of third-party libraries.  The error is often obfuscated by other, seemingly unrelated error messages, making debugging challenging.

The problem lies in the correct linking of native modules within the Android and iOS projects.  If these links fail, you might encounter runtime errors even though the JavaScript code seems correct.

**Key Points:**

* The issue involves third-party native libraries, not core React Native components.
* The error messages might not directly pinpoint the underlying problem.
* Solution often involves checking native module configurations within the Android and iOS projects.

This repository shows a simplified scenario where the error is easily demonstrable. Please carefully read the solutions provided.
